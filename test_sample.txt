Project Title: Advanced CAD Design System

Problem Statement:
Design and implement a comprehensive CAD (Computer-Aided Design) system that can handle complex engineering drawings with precision and accuracy. The system must support multiple file formats and provide high-quality text extraction capabilities.

Standard Rate Chart:
- Basic Design: $50 per hour
- Advanced Modeling: $75 per hour
- Complex Assembly: $100 per hour
- Technical Documentation: $60 per hour

Project Requirements:
1. Support for multiple CAD file formats
2. High-precision text extraction from drawings
3. Multi-language support for international teams
4. Real-time collaboration features
5. Version control system
6. Integration with existing engineering tools

Technical Specifications:
